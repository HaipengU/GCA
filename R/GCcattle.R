#' Cattle dataset 
#'
#' The cattle dataset is simulated with QMSim software (Sargolzaei and Schenkel, 2009).   
#' This dataset includes 2,500 individuals across six generations (from founder to generation 5), 
#' each with 10,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms spread over 29 autosomes. Single phenotype with heritability of 0.6 was simulated.
#' Two fixed covariates of sex and unit are available.
